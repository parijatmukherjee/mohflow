# MohFlow Technical Plan

## Project Overview

**MohFlow** is a Python logging library that provides structured JSON logging with multiple output handlers including console, file, and Grafana Loki integration. Currently at version 0.1.3, it's designed for easy setup with sensible defaults while providing powerful logging capabilities for modern Python applications.

## Architecture Analysis

### Core Components

#### Main Logger (`src/mohflow/logger/base.py`)

- **MohflowLogger**: Primary interface for logging operations
- Supports multiple log levels (INFO, ERROR, WARNING, DEBUG)
- JSON-formatted output with consistent schema
- Handler management for different output destinations

#### Configuration Management (`src/mohflow/config.py`)

- **LogConfig**: Pydantic-based configuration with environment variable support
- Environment prefix: `MOHFLOW_`
- Validation and type safety for configuration parameters
- Support for multiple environments (development, production)

#### Handler System (`src/mohflow/handlers/`)

- **LokiHandler**: Integration with Grafana Loki for centralized logging
- Extensible handler architecture for future integrations
- Error handling and configuration validation

#### Exception Handling (`src/mohflow/exceptions.py`)

- Custom exception hierarchy with `MohflowError` base class
- `ConfigurationError` for setup and configuration issues
