# Implementation Plan: Improve Sensitive Data Filter Configuration for Tracing Fields

**Branch**: `001-there-is-an` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-there-is-an/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Enhance the existing MohFlow logging library to provide configurable exemptions for distributed tracing fields (correlation_id, trace_id, span_id) while maintaining strong security through sensitive data filtering. The feature allows developers to preserve observability in distributed systems while protecting authentication credentials.

**User-provided context**: Ensure the feature in @specs/001-there-is-an/spec.md is still implemented properly. *MUST* Ensure All the tests are passing. *MUST* ensure make format and make lint has *ZERO* error.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.8+
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library, orjson (optional), structlog patterns
**Storage**: N/A (logging library)
**Testing**: pytest with fixtures and mocks
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform Python (Linux, Windows, macOS)
**Project Type**: Single library project
**Performance Goals**: <10ms log processing overhead, support for 10k+ logs/sec
**Constraints**: Zero-downtime logging, no crashes on failure, minimal memory footprint
**Scale/Scope**: Used in distributed systems with 100+ services, handling millions of log events daily

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Implementation Status**: ✅ FEATURE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

**Task Generation Strategy**:
Since the feature is already fully implemented, the /tasks command would generate validation and documentation tasks:

1. **Validation Tasks**:
   - Verify all 270 tests continue to pass
   - Confirm `make format` and `make lint` have zero errors
   - Performance regression testing
   - Integration testing with various logger configurations

2. **Documentation Tasks**:
   - Update README with new tracing exemption features
   - Add examples to API documentation
   - Create migration guide for existing users

3. **Monitoring Tasks**:
   - Set up performance benchmarks
   - Add telemetry for filter configuration usage
   - Create alerts for filter performance degradation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Validation first (ensure quality)
- Documentation second (user experience)
- Monitoring last (operational excellence)

**Current Status**: All implementation tasks completed, only maintenance tasks would remain

**IMPORTANT**: Since implementation is complete, /tasks would focus on operational readiness rather than development

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - ✅ COMPLETED
