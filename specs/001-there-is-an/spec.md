# Feature Specification: Improve Sensitive Data Filter Configuration for Tracing Fields

**Feature Branch**: `001-there-is-an`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "There is an issue created in the repo. Check and fix it."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Issue identified: GitHub Issue #24 - Enhancement for sensitive data filter
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: developers, logging system, distributed tracing systems
   ’ Actions: filter sensitive data, preserve tracing fields, configure exemptions
   ’ Data: correlation_id, request_id, trace_id, span_id, sensitive authentication data
   ’ Constraints: maintain security while preserving observability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Configuration interface design needs clarification
   ’ Default exemption list scope needs definition
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flows for distributed tracing logging
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and addresses the core issue
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Tracing field patterns, sensitive field patterns, filter configuration
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ Spec addresses business need for observability vs security balance
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with distributed systems, I need correlation IDs and trace IDs to remain visible in my logs so that I can debug issues across multiple services and maintain observability, while still protecting sensitive authentication data from being exposed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a logger with default sensitive data filtering enabled, **When** I log a message containing correlation_id, request_id, or trace_id, **Then** these tracing fields should remain visible and not be redacted
2. **Given** a logger with tracing field exemptions enabled, **When** I log a message containing both a correlation_id and an api_key, **Then** the correlation_id should be visible but the api_key should be redacted
3. **Given** a logger with custom safe field configuration, **When** I specify additional tracing fields to exempt, **Then** those custom fields should also remain visible in logs
4. **Given** a logger in a distributed system, **When** a request flows through multiple services with tracing headers, **Then** all services should log the same correlation identifiers for request tracking

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a tracing field contains a pattern that normally triggers sensitive data detection?
- How does the system handle custom tracing field names that contain substrings like "key" or "token"?
- What happens when tracing fields are nested within complex data structures?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide built-in exemptions for common distributed tracing fields (correlation_id, request_id, trace_id, span_id, transaction_id, session_id, operation_id)
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow configuration to disable tracing field exemptions for high-security environments
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to specify additional custom tracing fields to exempt from sensitive data filtering
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve the existing sensitive data filtering behavior for authentication and credential fields
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear configuration options during logger initialization for tracing field handling
- **FR-006**: System MUST use more precise pattern matching to avoid false positives when detecting sensitive data in field names
- **FR-007**: System MUST distinguish between field names that indicate tracing context versus authentication context
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to add and remove individual fields from the exemption list at runtime

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tracing Field Pattern**: Represents field naming patterns commonly used for distributed tracing (suffixes like _id, prefixes like trace_, correlation_, request_)
- **Sensitive Field Pattern**: Represents field naming patterns that indicate authentication or security data (key, token, password, secret)
- **Filter Configuration**: Represents the configuration state of what fields are exempt from filtering versus what fields require redaction
- **Field Context**: Represents the contextual classification of a field name (tracing, authentication, user data, etc.)
