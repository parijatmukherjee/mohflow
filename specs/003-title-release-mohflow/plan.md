# Implementation Plan: Release Mohflow v1.1.1 (Patch Release)

**Branch**: `003-title-release-mohflow` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/specs/003-title-release-mohflow/spec.md]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-title-release-mohflow/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Release Mohflow v1.1.1 as a patch version that packages the recently merged workflow scaffolding (PR #25) and enhanced sensitive data filter capabilities (PR #26) into a distributable release. The release must maintain SemVer patch constraints while ensuring all quality gates pass and documentation reflects the new features.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (logging library)
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard Python packaging tools (setuptools, wheel), git, GitHub CLI
**Storage**: Git repository, GitHub Releases, PyPI (package registry)
**Testing**: pytest, make test (comprehensive test suite)
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform Python package distribution
**Project Type**: Single library project with release automation
**Performance Goals**: N/A (release process, not runtime performance)
**Constraints**: SemVer patch release only, zero breaking changes, all quality gates must pass
**Scale/Scope**: Single patch release covering 2 merged PRs, version bump from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1

**User-Provided Implementation Details**:
- Bump version file(s) → 1.1.1
- Update CHANGELOG section per Deliverables
- Verify docs: tracing exemptions usage example added (short snippet)
- Run gates locally (`make format && make lint && make test`)
- Tag & push: `git tag v1.1.1 && git push origin v1.1.1`
- Create GitHub Release with notes

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitutional Compliance Assessment**:
- ✅ **Semantic Versioning**: Release follows SemVer patch increment (1.1.0 → 1.1.1)
- ✅ **Quality Gates**: All `make format`, `make lint`, `make test` must pass
- ✅ **Test-First & TDD**: No new code, only version/docs updates - N/A
- ✅ **Documentation as Feature**: CHANGELOG.md and docs updates included
- ✅ **Spec-Kit Flow**: Following /specify → /plan → /tasks workflow
- ✅ **Final Checks**: Release process includes `make test` verification
- ✅ **Minimal Dependencies**: No new dependencies added
- ✅ **Configurability**: No configuration changes in patch release

**Violations**: None identified - this is a standard release process

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Python library with standard structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate release process tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Version update task based on data model
- Changelog update task based on contracts
- Documentation update task for tracing exemptions
- Quality gate execution tasks (format, lint, test)
- Git tagging task based on contracts
- GitHub release creation task

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Sequential dependency order: Version → Changelog → Docs → Quality Gates → Tag → Release
- No parallel execution for release tasks (must be atomic)
- Quality gates must all pass before proceeding to tag/release

**Estimated Output**: 8-10 sequential, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
