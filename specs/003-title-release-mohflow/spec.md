# Feature Specification: Release Mohflow v1.1.1 (Patch Release)

**Feature Branch**: `003-title-release-mohflow`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "# Title: Release Mohflow v1.1.1 (Patch Release)

# Context:

- Current: v1.1.0 ’ Target: v1.1.1 (patch).
- Recently merged:
  - #25 "Add implementation planning and task generation workflows"  adds spec/plan/tasks templates & scripts for a structured feature workflow, plus a constitution update checklist.
  - #26 "Enhance Sensitive Data Filter with Tracing Field Exemptions"  preserves tracing fields (`correlation_id`, `request_id`, `trace_id`) while continuing to redact sensitive data; extensive TDD coverage; minor CI cleanup.

# Problem:

- v1.1.0 doesn't include the workflow scaffolding and the enhanced sensitive-data filtering. Docs + CI notes also need to reflect the new behavior and guardrails.

## Goals (What to achieve):

1) Cut and publish **v1.1.1** containing:
   - Workflow scaffolding from #25 (templates, scripts, constitution checklist).
   - Sensitive Data Filter enhancements from #26 (tracing field exemptions, tests).
   - CI cleanup from #26 (remove obsolete debug step).
2) Update **CHANGELOG.md** for 1.1.1 with Added/Changed notes (see Deliverables).
3) Ensure README/CONTRIBUTING/constitution are consistent with the new features and quality gates.

## Non-Goals:

- No public API breaking changes.
- No new sinks or runtime features beyond #26's filter enhancement.
- No dependency bumps unless required by CI.

## Constraints & Principles:

- SemVer patch release only.
- Must pass local + CI gates:
  - `make format` / `make lint` (zero errors), `make test`.
- Honor Constitution: TDD, Spec-Kit flow, Quality Gates, flake8 config.

## Deliverables:

- **CHANGELOG.md** entry:

  [1.1.1] - 2025-09-18
  - **Added**
    - Workflow scaffolding and automation for feature planning & task generation (PR #25).

- Enhanced Sensitive Data Filter with tracing field exemptions: keeps correlation_id, request_id, trace_id while redacting sensitive data; comprehensive TDD coverage (PR #26).
- **pyproject.toml** (or setup) version ’ `1.1.1`.
- **Git tag**: `v1.1.1`.
- **GitHub Release** notes mirroring CHANGELOG (links to #25 and #26).

- ## **Changed**

- Docs aligned with Constitution: TDD, Spec-Kit flow, Quality Gates (format/lint/test).
- CI cleanup: remove obsolete debug test step (from PR #26 follow-ups).

## Acceptance Criteria:

- CI green on main for tag build: `make format`, `make lint`, `make test` all pass.
- README/CONTRIBUTING/constitution mention:
- TDD (write tests first),
- flake8 rules (line length 79, E203 ignore, etc.),
- Final Checks (`make test`) before marking features complete.
- CHANGELOG shows 1.1.1 with PR references and today's date (Europe/Berlin)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Release specification contains clear deliverables and goals
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Development team, CI/CD system, End users
   ’ Actions: Version bump, changelog update, documentation alignment, tag creation, release publication
   ’ Data: Version numbers, PR references, dates, changelog entries
   ’ Constraints: SemVer patch release, quality gates, no breaking changes
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects are clearly specified in the description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Release process workflow clearly defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement corresponds to a specific deliverable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Version information, changelog entries, documentation files, git tags
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No implementation details present, focused on what needs to be delivered
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team member, I need to release Mohflow v1.1.1 as a patch version that includes the recently merged workflow scaffolding and sensitive data filter enhancements, so that users can benefit from these improvements while maintaining backward compatibility and quality standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current version is v1.1.0 and PRs #25 and #26 have been merged, **When** the release process is initiated, **Then** version 1.1.1 must be created with all quality gates passing
2. **Given** the CHANGELOG.md file exists, **When** the version is updated, **Then** it must contain a properly formatted 1.1.1 entry with today's date and references to PRs #25 and #26
3. **Given** the release artifacts are prepared, **When** the git tag is created, **Then** it must follow the pattern `v1.1.1` and trigger automated release processes
4. **Given** the GitHub release is published, **When** users view the release notes, **Then** they must see clear descriptions of new workflow scaffolding and enhanced sensitive data filtering capabilities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when quality gates (format/lint/test) fail during the release process?
- How does the system handle version conflicts if v1.1.1 already exists?
- What occurs if the changelog format doesn't match expected patterns?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST update version number to 1.1.1 in appropriate configuration files
- **FR-002**: System MUST create a properly formatted CHANGELOG.md entry for version 1.1.1 dated 2025-09-18
- **FR-003**: Release process MUST include references to PR #25 (workflow scaffolding) and PR #26 (sensitive data filter enhancements)
- **FR-004**: System MUST create a git tag `v1.1.1` pointing to the release commit
- **FR-005**: System MUST pass all quality gates (make format, make lint, make test) before release
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST be updated to reflect new workflow capabilities and quality standards
- **FR-007**: GitHub release MUST be published with release notes mirroring the changelog
- **FR-008**: Release MUST maintain SemVer patch version constraints (no breaking changes)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Version Information**: Represents the semantic version number (1.1.1), stored in configuration files
- **Changelog Entry**: Contains release date, version number, added features, and PR references
- **Git Tag**: Immutable reference to the specific commit representing the release
- **Release Notes**: Human-readable description of changes for end users and stakeholders
- **Quality Gate Results**: Status of automated checks (formatting, linting, testing) that must pass
