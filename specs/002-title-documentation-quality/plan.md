# Implementation Plan: Documentation & Quality Gates Hardening for Mohflow

**Branch**: `002-title-documentation-quality` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-title-documentation-quality/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   ✓ Feature spec loaded successfully
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   ✓ Project Type: single (documentation feature)
   ✓ Structure Decision: Option 1 (DEFAULT)
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   ✓ No violations - documentation hardening aligns with constitutional principles
   ✓ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   ✓ No NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain - all requirements clear
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   ✓ No new violations - design maintains constitutional compliance
   ✓ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 8. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Harden documentation and quality gates for Mohflow to enable new contributors to quickly understand installation, usage, TDD workflow, quality gates, and spec-kit development process. Technical approach involves updating existing documentation files (README.md, constitution.md) and creating new ones (CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md) with specific sections for quickstart, quality gates, TDD workflow, and contribution guidelines.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (existing Mohflow library)
**Primary Dependencies**: Existing Mohflow dependencies + documentation tools (Markdown)
**Storage**: N/A (documentation files only)
**Testing**: pytest (for TDD examples and validation)
**Target Platform**: Repository documentation (GitHub)
**Project Type**: single (documentation hardening for existing library)
**Performance Goals**: N/A (documentation feature)
**Constraints**: Must maintain consistency with existing CI configuration, follow Keep-a-Changelog format
**Scale/Scope**: 4 documentation files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, constitution.md, CHANGELOG.md)

**User-Provided Implementation Details**:
# Title: Documentation & Quality Gates Hardening for Mohflow

# Plan:

## Files to Update / Create

### 1. README.md
- **Add Quickstart section** at the top:
  - Installation instructions (`pip install mohflow` once published, or local install).
  - Minimal code snippet showing a JSON log output.
  - Output example in JSON format.
- **Add Quality Gates section**:
  - Show required commands: `make format`, `make lint`, `make test`
  - State they must pass locally before PR.
  - Mention GitHub Actions will enforce the same.
- **Add TDD Workflow section**:
  - Outline the 3-step cycle: write failing test → implement → refactor.
  - Provide a tiny test example (pytest).
- **Add Spec-Kit Workflow section**:
  - `/specify → /plan → /tasks` with one-line description each.
  - Example of where new specs go (`specs/`).
- **Add CI Badge**: GitHub Actions badge for Python CI workflow.
- **Add Supported Python Versions**: Current supported versions list.

### 2. CONTRIBUTING.md (new file if not present)
- **Add Contributor Onboarding**: Fork/clone instructions, environment setup.
- **Pre-PR Checklist**: Specs written, TDD followed, quality gates pass, docs updated.
- **Branch Naming**: `feat/<short-desc>`, `fix/<short-desc>`, `chore/<short-desc>`.
- **Review Expectations**: Coverage, performance considerations, backwards-compatibility.

### 3. constitution.md
- Already exists; update to ensure: TDD Principle, Quality Gates, Flake8 Configuration, Final Checks section.

### 4. CHANGELOG.md (new file if not present)
- Create changelog following Keep-a-Changelog format with "Unreleased" section.

### 5. Documentation Cleanup
- **Remove unnecessary files**: Clean up outdated and redundant documentation
- **Files to remove**:
  - `SECURITY.md` (generic template with placeholder content)
  - `TECHNICAL_PLAN.md` (outdated technical plan conflicting with current structure)
  - `benchmarks/README.md` (benchmarking docs not essential for core contributor workflow)
- **Rationale**: Focus on essential documentation that directly supports contributor onboarding and development workflow

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**✓ III. Test-First & TDD (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Documentation feature promotes TDD workflow understanding
**✓ VII. Documentation as a Feature**: This feature directly addresses documentation requirements
**✓ IX. Spec-Kit Flow (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Documentation explains spec-kit workflow to contributors
**✓ XI. Quality Gates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Documentation explains and reinforces quality gate requirements
**✓ XII. Final Checks**: Documentation explains final testing requirements

**Result**: PASS - All constitutional principles are supported by this documentation hardening feature

# Documentation files (target of this feature)
README.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
constitution.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (DEFAULT) - Single project structure for documentation updates

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
*No unknowns to research - all requirements clearly specified in feature spec*

**Research Findings**:
- Documentation requirements are well-defined in feature specification
- Existing constitution.md provides foundation for quality gates documentation
- GitHub Actions workflow exists and needs to be referenced in documentation
- Make targets (format, lint, test) are established and need documentation
- Keep-a-Changelog format is industry standard for CHANGELOG.md

**Output**: research.md with consolidated findings

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

**Documentation Entity Model**:
- README.md: Primary entry point with quickstart, quality gates, TDD, spec-kit sections
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Contributor guidance with checklists and conventions
- constitution.md: Updated governance with explicit quality gate rules
- CHANGELOG.md: Release history following standard format

**Documentation Contracts** (content specifications):
- Quickstart section must provide working code example
- Quality gates section must list exact commands and requirements
- TDD workflow must include 3-step process with test example
- Spec-kit workflow must explain three commands with usage examples
- Contributing checklist must be copy-pasteable for PR preparation

**Validation Approach**:
- Example code in README must be validated against actual library API
- Make commands referenced must exist and work
- CI badge must point to actual GitHub Actions workflow
- Links between documents must be functional

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks for each documentation file update/creation
- Each functional requirement → documentation task
- Each content section → specific writing task
- Validation tasks for cross-document consistency

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Research existing files first
- Remove unnecessary documentation files (cleanup phase)
- Update README.md (primary entry point)
- Create/update CONTRIBUTING.md (contributor guidance)
- Update constitution.md (governance alignment)
- Create/update CHANGELOG.md (release management)
- Final validation and consistency checks

**Estimated Output**: 18-22 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (validate documentation accuracy, test examples, check consistency)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations - documentation hardening supports all principles*

No entries required.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
