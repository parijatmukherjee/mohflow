# Data Model: Documentation & Quality Gates Hardening

## Documentation Entity Model

### Primary Documentation Entities

#### README.md
**Purpose**: Primary entry point for users and contributors
**Required Sections**:
- Title and description
- CI badge
- Supported Python versions
- Quickstart section (installation + minimal example)
- Quality Gates section (make commands + CI requirements)
- TDD Workflow section (3-step process + test example)
- Spec-Kit Workflow section (three commands + examples)

**Content Specifications**:
- Installation instructions: Both pip and local development
- Code example: Must produce JSON output
- Quality gate commands: Exact make targets with zero-error requirement
- TDD example: pytest-based test demonstrating fail-implement-pass cycle
- Spec-kit commands: /specify, /plan, /tasks with one-line descriptions

#### CONTRIBUTING.md
**Purpose**: Comprehensive contributor guidance
**Required Sections**:
- Getting started (fork/clone/setup)
- Pre-PR checklist (copy-pasteable)
- Branch naming conventions
- Review expectations
- Links to constitution.md

**Content Specifications**:
- Environment setup: Virtual environment creation and activation
- Checklist items: Specs written, TDD followed, quality gates passed, docs updated
- Branch patterns: feat/, fix/, chore/ prefixes
- Review criteria: Coverage, performance, backwards-compatibility

#### constitution.md
**Purpose**: Project governance and principles (existing file to update)
**Required Updates**:
- Ensure TDD principle is explicit and non-negotiable
- Include quality gates with exact flake8 configuration
- Add final checks section requiring make test success
- Maintain existing constitutional principles

**Content Specifications**:
- TDD workflow: Explicit 3-step process requirement
- Quality gates: Zero-error requirement for format/lint
- Final checks: make test must pass locally and in CI
- Flake8 config: Reference to actual .flake8 file

#### CHANGELOG.md
**Purpose**: Release history and change tracking
**Required Structure**:
- Header with Keep-a-Changelog reference
- Unreleased section for pending changes
- Versioned sections with dates
- Categorized changes (Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security)

**Content Specifications**:
- Format: Keep-a-Changelog v1.0.0 standard
- Categories: Standard semantic categories
- Entries: Clear, actionable descriptions of changes

### Documentation Contracts

#### Content Quality Contract
- All code examples must be runnable
- All make commands must exist and function
- All links must be functional
- All badges must point to actual CI workflows

#### Consistency Contract
- Quality gate commands consistent across all files
- TDD workflow explanation consistent between README and CONTRIBUTING
- Branch naming patterns consistent with actual repository practices
- Python version requirements consistent with actual library support

#### Maintainability Contract
- Examples validated against actual API
- CI references match actual GitHub Actions workflows
- Make targets match actual Makefile
- Flake8 config references actual .flake8 file

### Validation Rules

#### Content Validation
- Code examples → Must execute successfully against Mohflow library
- Make commands → Must exist in Makefile and execute without errors
- CI badges → Must point to existing GitHub Actions workflows
- Links → Must resolve to existing files or valid URLs

#### Consistency Validation
- Cross-references → All internal links must be functional
- Command references → Same commands referenced consistently across files
- Version numbers → Python versions must match across all documentation
- Process descriptions → TDD and spec-kit workflows consistent everywhere

#### Completeness Validation
- Required sections → All mandatory sections present in each file
- Functional requirements → All FR-001 through FR-012 addressed
- Acceptance criteria → All specified acceptance criteria met
- User scenarios → All documented scenarios supported by content

## State Transitions

### Documentation Lifecycle
1. **Draft** → Documentation created with placeholder content
2. **Content Complete** → All required sections written
3. **Validated** → All examples tested and links verified
4. **Consistent** → Cross-document consistency confirmed
5. **Released** → Documentation published and CHANGELOG updated

### Quality Gate Process
1. **Documentation Updated** → New content added
2. **Examples Validated** → Code examples tested
3. **Commands Verified** → Make targets confirmed working
4. **Links Checked** → All references validated
5. **Ready for Review** → Documentation meets all quality criteria
