# Tasks: Documentation & Quality Gates Hardening for Mohflow

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-title-documentation-quality/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ✓ Implementation plan loaded with tech stack: Markdown, Python 3.11+, pytest
   ✓ Extract: documentation entities (README, CONTRIBUTING, constitution, CHANGELOG)
2. Load optional design documents:
   ✓ data-model.md: Documentation entities → content creation tasks
   ✓ contracts/: 5 content contracts → validation tasks
   ✓ research.md: Technical decisions → documentation approach
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ✓ Setup: environment validation, existing content analysis
   ✓ Tests: content validation, example code testing
   ✓ Core: documentation file creation/updates
   ✓ Integration: cross-document consistency, CI integration
   ✓ Polish: final validation, cleanup
4. Apply task rules:
   ✓ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   ✓ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ✓ Content validation before implementation
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   ✓ All contracts have validation tests
   ✓ All documentation entities have creation tasks
   ✓ All cleanup actions included
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Repository root**: Documentation files at `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/`
- **Constitution**: `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- **CI config**: `.github/workflows/`

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Analysis
- [ ] T001 Analyze existing documentation structure and identify current Makefile targets
- [ ] T002 [P] Validate GitHub Actions workflow exists and get actual badge URL
- [ ] T003 [P] Check current Python version support in CI and project configuration
- [ ] T004 [P] Verify Mohflow library API for code examples in `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/src/mohflow/`

## Phase 3.2: Content Validation (MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3)
**CRITICAL: These validation tasks MUST identify requirements before ANY content creation**
- [ ] T005 [P] Validate README-content contract against current `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/README.md`
- [ ] T006 [P] Validate CONTRIBUTING-content contract requirements for new file creation
- [ ] T007 [P] Validate constitution-updates contract against `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- [ ] T008 [P] Validate CHANGELOG-content contract for new file creation
- [ ] T009 [P] Test example code from quickstart.md against actual Mohflow API

## Phase 3.3: Documentation Cleanup (ONLY after validation complete)
- [ ] T010 [P] Remove `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/SECURITY.md` (generic template)
- [ ] T011 [P] Remove `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/TECHNICAL_PLAN.md` (outdated technical plan)
- [ ] T012 [P] Remove `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/benchmarks/README.md` (specialized docs)

## Phase 3.4: Core Documentation Creation
- [ ] T013 Update `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/README.md` with quickstart section and CI badge
- [ ] T014 Add quality gates section to `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/README.md`
- [ ] T015 Add TDD workflow section to `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/README.md`
- [ ] T016 Add spec-kit workflow section to `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/README.md`
- [ ] T017 Create `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/CONTRIBUTING.md` with getting started section
- [ ] T018 Add pre-PR checklist to `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] T019 Add branch naming conventions to `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [ ] T020 Update `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/.specify/memory/constitution.md` with enhanced quality gates
- [ ] T021 Add flake8 configuration reference to constitution.md
- [ ] T022 Create `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/CHANGELOG.md` with Keep-a-Changelog format

## Phase 3.5: Integration & Consistency
- [ ] T023 Validate all internal links work correctly across documentation files
- [ ] T024 Ensure make commands referenced in docs match actual Makefile targets
- [ ] T025 Verify CI badge URL points to correct GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] T026 Test all code examples execute successfully against current Mohflow version

## Phase 3.6: Polish & Final Validation
- [ ] T027 [P] Run final content validation against all contract specifications
- [ ] T028 [P] Verify constitutional compliance of all documentation updates
- [ ] T029 [P] Test contributor workflow end-to-end using new documentation
- [ ] T030 Update CHANGELOG.md with documentation hardening entry in Unreleased section

## Dependencies
- Analysis (T001-T004) before validation (T005-T009)
- Validation (T005-T009) before cleanup (T010-T012)
- Cleanup (T010-T012) before content creation (T013-T022)
- Content creation (T013-T022) before integration (T023-T026)
- Integration (T023-T026) before final polish (T027-T030)
- T013-T016 are sequential (same README.md file)
- T017-T019 are sequential (same CONTRIBUTING.md file)
- T020-T021 are sequential (same constitution.md file)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T002-T004 together:
Task: "Validate GitHub Actions workflow exists and get actual badge URL"
Task: "Check current Python version support in CI and project configuration"
Task: "Verify Mohflow library API for code examples"

# Launch T005-T009 together:
Task: "Validate README-content contract against current README.md"
Task: "Validate CONTRIBUTING-content contract requirements"
Task: "Validate constitution-updates contract against constitution.md"
Task: "Validate CHANGELOG-content contract for new file creation"
Task: "Test example code from quickstart.md against actual Mohflow API"

# Launch T010-T012 together:
Task: "Remove SECURITY.md (generic template)"
Task: "Remove TECHNICAL_PLAN.md (outdated technical plan)"
Task: "Remove benchmarks/README.md (specialized docs)"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Test all code examples before including in documentation
- Maintain constitutional compliance throughout
- Verify all cross-references and links work

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → validation task [P]
   - Each documentation entity → creation task

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each documentation entity → content creation task
   - Cross-references → consistency tasks

3. **From User Stories**:
   - New contributor scenario → workflow validation
   - Quality gates scenario → command validation

4. **Ordering**:
   - Analysis → Validation → Cleanup → Creation → Integration → Polish
   - Sequential tasks for same file modifications

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding validation tasks
- [x] All documentation entities have creation tasks
- [x] All validation comes before content creation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Cleanup tasks precede content creation
- [x] Constitutional compliance verified
- [x] Cross-document consistency ensured
