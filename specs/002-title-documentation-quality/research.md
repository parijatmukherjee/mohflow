# Research: Documentation & Quality Gates Hardening

## Research Findings

### Current State Analysis

**Decision**: Use existing repository structure and build upon current documentation
**Rationale**: Mohflow already has established patterns and a constitution.md file that provides a foundation for quality gates documentation
**Alternatives considered**: Starting from scratch would lose existing valuable content and disrupt contributor familiarity

### Documentation Standards

**Decision**: Follow GitHub best practices with Keep-a-Changelog format for CHANGELOG.md
**Rationale**: Industry standard format that's widely recognized and provides clear structure for release notes
**Alternatives considered**: Custom changelog format would be less familiar to contributors

### Quality Gates Integration

**Decision**: Reference existing Make targets (format, lint, test) and GitHub Actions workflow
**Rationale**: Documentation should reflect actual implementation to avoid drift between docs and CI
**Alternatives considered**: Documenting hypothetical commands would create inconsistency

### TDD Workflow Documentation

**Decision**: Include minimal working pytest example with 3-step TDD cycle
**Rationale**: Concrete examples are more effective than abstract descriptions for teaching TDD
**Alternatives considered**: Pure conceptual explanation would be less actionable for new contributors

### Spec-Kit Workflow Integration

**Decision**: Document the three-command workflow (/specify → /plan → /tasks) with practical examples
**Rationale**: Contributors need clear guidance on how to use the established development process
**Alternatives considered**: External documentation would be harder to discover and maintain

### CI Badge Integration

**Decision**: Include GitHub Actions badge for main workflow status
**Rationale**: Provides immediate visibility into project health and CI status
**Alternatives considered**: No badge would miss opportunity for transparency; multiple badges would clutter README

### Content Organization Strategy

**Decision**:
- README.md: Primary entry point with quickstart and overview
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Detailed contributor guidance and checklists
- constitution.md: Updated governance rules
- CHANGELOG.md: Release history

**Rationale**: Separates concerns appropriately - README for users and quick contributors, CONTRIBUTING.md for detailed contribution process
**Alternatives considered**: Single large README would be overwhelming; multiple small files would fragment information flow

## Technical Decisions

### Python Version Support

**Decision**: Document current supported Python versions (3.11+)
**Rationale**: Must match actual library requirements for accuracy
**Alternatives considered**: Aspirational version support would mislead users about compatibility

### Example Code Validation

**Decision**: Ensure all code examples in documentation are validated against actual Mohflow API
**Rationale**: Prevents documentation drift and ensures examples actually work
**Alternatives considered**: Unvalidated examples risk becoming outdated and confusing users

### Cross-Document Consistency

**Decision**: Establish clear linking strategy between documentation files
**Rationale**: Creates a cohesive documentation experience and reduces duplication
**Alternatives considered**: Isolated documents would require repetition and risk inconsistency

## Research Validation

All documentation requirements from the feature specification have been analyzed and implementation approaches determined. No technical unknowns remain that would require additional research phases.
