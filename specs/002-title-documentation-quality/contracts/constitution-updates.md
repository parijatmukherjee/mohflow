## Content Preservation Requirements

### Existing Constitutional Principles
- All current principles (I-XII) must be preserved
- No existing content should be removed without justification
- Updates should enhance, not replace, existing content
- Constitutional numbering and structure must be maintained

### Principle Alignment
- Updates must strengthen existing principles
- No contradictions with current constitutional requirements
- Enhanced clarity without changing fundamental meanings
- Backward compatibility with existing interpretations

## Specific Content Updates

### Enhanced Section XI (Quality Gates)
```markdown
### XI. Quality Gates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **CI Validation**: All code must pass the GitHub Actions workflow before merging.
- **Formatting & Linting**: The following commands must run with **zero errors** before any commit is accepted:
  ```bash
  make format
  make lint
  ```
- **Flake8 Configuration**: All linting rules are defined in `.flake8` and enforced consistently in CI.
- **Local Development**: Contributors must run quality gates locally before submitting PRs.
```

### Enhanced Section XII (Final Checks)
```markdown
### XII. Final Checks
- Before communicating a feature as COMPLETE, the following must be run locally and in CI:
  ```bash
  make test
  ```
- All tests must pass successfully.
- A feature is not considered finished until both local and CI tests are green.
- **Definition of COMPLETE**: A feature meets all acceptance criteria, passes all quality gates, and has been validated through the full test suite.
```

### New Flake8 Configuration Reference
```markdown
### Flake8 Configuration
The project's code quality standards are enforced through flake8 with configuration defined in `.flake8`:
- Configuration is consistently applied in local development and CI
- Zero tolerance for linting violations in main branch
- All rules are documented and justified for project needs
- Contributors should run `make lint` before submitting changes
```

## Constitutional Compliance

### Non-Negotiable Principles
- TDD (III): Enhanced Final Checks support test-first development
- Spec-Kit Flow (IX): Documentation hardening supports specification process
- Quality Gates (XI): Enhanced with specific tooling and zero-error requirements
- Final Checks (XII): Clarified definition of feature completion

### Integration Requirements
- Updates must reference actual repository tooling
- CI workflow names must match actual GitHub Actions
- Make targets must exist and function as documented
- File references (.flake8) must point to existing files
