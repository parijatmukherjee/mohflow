git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mohflow.git
cd mohflow

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
python -c "from mohflow import MohflowLogger; print('âœ“ MohFlow development setup complete')"
```
