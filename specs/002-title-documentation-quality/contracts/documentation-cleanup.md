# Documentation Cleanup Contract

## Files to Remove

### 1. SECURITY.md
**Location**: `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/SECURITY.md`
**Reason for Removal**: Generic GitHub template with placeholder content
**Content Analysis**:
- Contains only template text ("Use this section to tell people...")
- No actual security policy or vulnerability reporting process
- Version table with placeholder information
- Does not provide value to contributors or users

**Replacement Strategy**: Security information will be incorporated into CONTRIBUTING.md if needed

### 2. TECHNICAL_PLAN.md
**Location**: `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/TECHNICAL_PLAN.md`
**Reason for Removal**: Outdated technical documentation that conflicts with current documentation structure
**Content Analysis**:
- 300+ lines of technical architecture details
- Contains roadmap and implementation plans that may be outdated
- Duplicates information that should be in README or CONTRIBUTING
- Creates confusion with multiple documentation sources
- Not aligned with spec-kit workflow and current development practices

**Replacement Strategy**: Relevant technical information will be integrated into README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md

### 3. benchmarks/README.md
**Location**: `/Users/parijatmukherjee/workspace/mohflow/benchmarks/README.md`
**Reason for Removal**: Specialized documentation not essential for core contributor workflow
**Content Analysis**:
- Performance benchmarking suite documentation
- Detailed technical information about performance testing
- Not required for basic contribution workflow
- Adds complexity for new contributors
- Can be maintained separately or in code comments

**Replacement Strategy**: Keep benchmarking tools but remove dedicated README to simplify contributor experience

## Cleanup Validation

### Before Removal Checklist
- [ ] Verify no critical information exists only in these files
- [ ] Check for any references to these files in other documentation
- [ ] Ensure no CI/CD processes depend on these files
- [ ] Confirm removal aligns with documentation hardening goals

### After Removal Validation
- [ ] No broken links in remaining documentation
- [ ] All essential information preserved in core documentation files
- [ ] Simplified documentation structure achieved
- [ ] New contributor experience improved

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
- **Reduced complexity**: Fewer files for contributors to navigate
- **Clearer focus**: Essential documentation is more prominent
- **Maintenance reduction**: Fewer files to keep updated and consistent
- **Better onboarding**: New contributors see only relevant documentation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Information preservation**: Any valuable content will be integrated into core files
- **Gradual transition**: Removal will be part of coordinated documentation update
- **Documentation audit**: Ensure no critical processes are disrupted

## Constitutional Alignment

### Documentation as a Feature (VII)
- Cleanup supports principle by focusing on quality over quantity
- Removes outdated documentation that could mislead contributors
- Aligns with keeping documentation updated and relevant

### Quality Gates (XI)
- Simplifies documentation maintenance and consistency checking
- Reduces surface area for documentation drift
- Supports zero-error approach by having fewer files to validate

## Integration with Documentation Hardening

### Cleanup Order
1. **Analysis phase**: Verify content and dependencies
2. **Preservation phase**: Extract any valuable information
3. **Integration phase**: Add preserved content to core documentation
4. **Removal phase**: Delete unnecessary files
5. **Validation phase**: Confirm no broken references

### Content Migration
- **SECURITY.md**: Security considerations → CONTRIBUTING.md security section
- **TECHNICAL_PLAN.md**: Architecture overview → README.md technical section
- **benchmarks/README.md**: No migration needed (tools remain functional)

## Success Criteria

### Documentation Structure
- Repository contains only essential documentation files
- Clear hierarchy: README.md → CONTRIBUTING.md → constitution.md
- No duplicate or conflicting information
- Streamlined contributor experience

### Functionality Preservation
- All tools and processes continue to function
- No loss of critical information
- Improved discoverability of important content
- Better alignment with constitutional principles
