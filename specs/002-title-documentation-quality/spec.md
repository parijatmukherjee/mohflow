# Feature Specification: Documentation & Quality Gates Hardening for Mohflow

**Feature Branch**: `002-title-documentation-quality`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Title: Documentation & Quality Gates Hardening for Mohflow

Context:
- Mohflow is a Python structured logging library (JSON-first) that targets console, files, and aggregators (e.g., Loki).
- spec-kit has been initialized in the repository. We've defined strict principles: TDD, CI must pass, `make format` and `make lint` must be zero-error, and flake8 rules are standardized.
- We need the repo documentation to clearly communicate how to use Mohflow, how to contribute, and how quality gates work (local + CI).

Problem:
- Current documentation does not fully describe:
  - TDD requirement for new features and how to run tests locally.
  - Enforced formatting/linting standards and exact flake8 settings.
  - The required Makefile flow (`make format`, `make lint`, `make test`) and GitHub Actions checks.
  - Contributor expectations (spec-kit flow, branch naming, PR checklist).
- New contributors won't reliably follow the constitution without explicit, discoverable docs.

Goals (What to achieve):
1) Update / add documentation so that a new contributor can:
   - Install and use Mohflow quickly (Quickstart).
   - Understand structured-logging conventions and examples.
   - Follow TDD for any new feature (write failing tests ’ implement ’ refactor).
   - Run `make format`, `make lint`, and `make test` locally with zero errors.
   - Understand that GitHub Actions must be green before merge.
   - Follow the spec-kit flow: `/specify ’ /plan ’ /tasks`.
2) Surface our flake8 configuration and quality gates prominently.
3) Add a concise PR checklist to reduce back-and-forth in reviews.

Non-Goals:
- No new runtime features or refactors to library internals in this spec.
- No docs website generation (mkdocs/sphinx) yetkeep to repo Markdown.
- No changes to licensing or governance.

Constraints & Principles:
- Follow the Mohflow Constitution (Structured-First, Minimal Deps, TDD, Spec-Kit Flow, Quality Gates).
- Formatting/linting is non-negotiable; CI must enforce the same rules as local.
- Keep docs succinct, example-driven, and ready for copy-paste.

Deliverables (Documentation):
- README.md:
  - Add TL;DR Quickstart (install, minimal usage snippet, JSON output example).
  - Add "Quality Gates" section: explain `make format`, `make lint`, `make test` and CI requirements.
  - Add "TDD Workflow" mini-guide (3 steps) with a tiny test example scaffold.
  - Show flake8 rules inline or link to `.flake8`.
  - Add build/CI badge(s) and tested Python versions.
  - Add "Spec-Kit Workflow" subsection with the three commands and short examples.
- CONTRIBUTING.md (new or expanded):
  - Pre-PR checklist:
    - Specs written under `specs/` for non-trivial changes.
    - TDD followed; tests added/updated.
    - `make format && make lint && make test` all green locally.
    - Update README/docstrings as needed.
  - Branch naming & PR title conventions (feat/fix/chore).
  - Review expectations (coverage, perf considerations, backwards-compat).
- constitution.md:
  - Confirm inclusion of TDD, CI rules, Make commands, and flake8 config block (as agreed).
  - Add "Final Checks" section: feature is COMPLETE only when `make test` passes locally and CI is green.
- CHANGELOG.md:
  - Create or update with Keep-a-Changelog style; add an "Unreleased" section.

Acceptance Criteria:
- A new contributor can clone the repo and, using README + CONTRIBUTING:
  - Run `make format`, `make lint`, `make test` successfully.
  - Understand TDD expectations and add a passing test for a trivial example.
  - Understand spec-kit flow and where to place new specs.
- README shows:
  - Quickstart install + minimal code snippet that prints a JSON log.
  - Clear commands for format/lint/test.
  - CI badge visible at the top.
- CONTRIBUTING.md contains a copy-paste PR checklist and links to constitution.md.
- constitution.md includes:
  - TDD (non-negotiable), Quality Gates (non-negotiable), flake8 settings, Final Checks (`make test` before "COMPLETE").
- No inconsistencies between README, CONTRIBUTING, constitution.md, and CI.

Risks & Mitigations:
- Risk: Docs drift from CI config.
  - Mitigation: Reference `.flake8` and Make targets directly; CI uses the same commands.
- Risk: Overlong README.
  - Mitigation: Keep examples short; deeper details in CONTRIBUTING.

Telemetry (optional):
- Track CI failure reasons distribution (lint vs test) to improve docs over time.

Notes for /plan:
- Generate concrete file edits for README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, constitution.md, CHANGELOG.md.
- Ensure any example code in README is runnable in tests/examples to avoid drift."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description provided with clear documentation requirements
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: New contributors, maintainers, CI systems
   ’ Actions: Install, use library, contribute code, run quality gates
   ’ Data: Documentation files, code examples, CI configurations
   ’ Constraints: TDD requirement, quality gates, spec-kit flow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects are clearly defined in the user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flow clearly defined: new contributor onboarding and contribution
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Requirements extracted from acceptance criteria and deliverables
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Documentation entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers required
   ’ No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A new contributor wants to start using and contributing to Mohflow. They need to quickly understand how to install the library, use it effectively, and follow the project's development practices including TDD, quality gates, and the spec-kit workflow.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new contributor clones the Mohflow repository, **When** they read the README, **Then** they can install Mohflow and run a basic example that produces JSON structured logs
2. **Given** a contributor wants to add a feature, **When** they follow the documented TDD workflow, **Then** they can write failing tests, implement the feature, and verify all quality gates pass locally
3. **Given** a contributor prepares a pull request, **When** they use the CONTRIBUTING.md checklist, **Then** they ensure all required steps are completed and CI will pass
4. **Given** a contributor uses the spec-kit workflow, **When** they run `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks` commands, **Then** they understand where to place specifications and follow the structured development process
5. **Given** documentation exists for quality gates, **When** a contributor runs `make format`, `make lint`, and `make test`, **Then** all commands execute successfully with zero errors

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a contributor's code fails quality gates locally vs CI?
- How does the system handle inconsistencies between documentation and actual CI configuration?
- What guidance exists for contributors unfamiliar with TDD or spec-kit workflows?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
